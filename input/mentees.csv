I accepted a new job as a software engineer, but thinking of it, I feel super anxious and somehow constrained. 
Thinking of my volunteering experience, I love being part of the tech eco-system and organise events where people are creative and try to express themselves. 
As a developer, I love building cool products that people can use. It's a nerdy feeling - like in the math class when you solve a problem and get X out of equation.

Lately, I felt a lot of pressure in doing any of these things, a pressure that got me extremely overwhelmed. 

I would love to meet someone who figured out how to stay true to themselves and who could help me figure out different ways to find the missing pieces in my mental picture.
